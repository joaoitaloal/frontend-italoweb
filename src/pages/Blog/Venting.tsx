            <p>Hey there! quick explanation about this page: these are basically random thoughts that i write sometimes and decided to put them here, they are overly dramatic and melancholic so i will not make them directly public</p>
            <p>Also dont worry about me based on what i write here, its really just venting, i am fine</p>
            <p>So yeah thats a easter egg page almost</p>
            <hr />
            <div>
                <p>Everything ends, sometimes it is necessary to end things, maybe before it starts declining</p>
                <p>
                    Was thinking, if i knew i would die next year, what would i do?
                        probably quit college and start reading a lot of shit i want
                        maybe nothing maybe i would just die
                </p>
                <p>
                    A lot of shit already ended to be honest, there is a lot of good times i can remember, they are gone, they were good but they are gone.
                    Everything is fine in the present though so maybe it doesn't matter if everything ends, since generally theres more to come, unless you die then theres not a lot after probably.
                    Not even sure of that though.
